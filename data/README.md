This directory serves as the 'drop' location for a local export of activities following a certain minimum expected structure:

```
export.zip/
└── activities/
    ├── activity1.tcx.gz/
    │   └── activity1.tcx
    ├── activity2.fit.gz/
    │   └── activity2.fit
    └── ...
```

See the [root README](../README.md) for more information about supported activity file types.

One possible way to get data in this format is the [bulk export procedure provided by Strava](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918437-Exporting-your-Data-and-Bulk-Export) if using that service.
